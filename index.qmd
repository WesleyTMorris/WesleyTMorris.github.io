## About Me

Wesley Morris recently earned a Ph.D. in Education Policy from UNC Chapel Hill. His research examines the early career teacher pipeline, focusing on how policies affect teacher labor markets and influence teacher quality. He pays particular attention to rural schools, studying how well-intentioned reforms can lead to unintended consequences and how policy can be better designed to support students, educators, and leaders in rural communities. Committed to bridging the gap between research, policy, and practice, Wesley works closely with policymakers and practitioners to ensure his research is both informed by their expertise and supports the tough decisions they make every day.
