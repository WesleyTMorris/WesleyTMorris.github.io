## Summary

In the seven years since Tennessee implemented a statewide teacher evaluation system, the percentage of Tennessee teachers who agree that the evaluation system has improved their teaching doubled, going from 38 percent in 2012 to 76 percent in 2019. This rise in satisfaction with evaluation has coincided with increases in student performance on the National Assessment of Education Progress (especially in 2013) and teacher effectiveness (Aldrich, 2019; Putman, Walsh, & Ross, 2018).
Still, there is room for improvement. One-quarter of current teachers don’t agree that evaluation has improved their teaching, and this group of teachers is especially likely to view the system as unfair and burdensome.
Using data from the annual Tennessee Educator Survey, this snapshot investigates ways that teacher preparation programs, districts, and schools provide teachers with information and supports for evaluation, and how these supports are associated with teacher perceptions of evaluation fairness and burden. Better understanding of how teachers feel about the evaluation process and the supports they receive provides insight into potential levers available to districts and schools to improve the implementation of Tennessee’s statewide educator evaluation system.
