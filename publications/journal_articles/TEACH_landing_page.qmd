## Abstract

Created in 2007, the federal TEACH grant program is a large federal financial aid program that seeks to attract postsecondary students to the teaching profession by providing financial assistance to help pay for a teaching degree. This paper describes the uptake and usage of the federal TEACH grant program across a large four-year public university system. Initial findings suggest that there is considerable room for expanding the number of preservice teachers and institutions utilizing the TEACH grants. While I find no evidence that receiving a TEACH grant reduces student borrowing, these grants do reduce the out-of-pocket costs students face to attend college. Finally, I estimate that students who receive a TEACH grant are approximately 7 percentage points more likely than their peers in the same degree program to continue in and complete teacher education programs. Considering the federal governmentâ€™s recent interest in reforms to this program, I discuss the implications of this work on potential reform options.
