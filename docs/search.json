    "text": "Online course offerings at traditional universities have become common, though some question if the modality can adequately substitute for an in-person experience. We explore undergraduate online course enrollment at a large public four-year system and the relationships between taking online courses and student outcomes. Online enrollment nearly doubled from 2012 to 2019 when almost 40 percent took at least one class online. Female students and older students were especially likely to take online classes. Overall students were both more likely to earn As and more likely to fail in online courses relative to in-person courses, but semester GPAs were higher in terms when students took at least one class online than when they took all in-person classes. Importantly, taking higher shares of courses online is associated with increased degree completion with the largest benefits for younger students and male students."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Nationally, teachers have experienced major changes to how their performance is evaluated. Teacher satisfaction with the evaluation system likely influences whether they will use the evaluation data to make instructional improvements, yet we know little about teachers’ perceptions of their evaluations. Using survey data from Chicago Public Schools, we explore teacher satisfaction with the evaluation system and their perceptions of its fairness and accuracy. Sixty percent of teachers reported being satisfied with the district’s reformed teacher evaluation. However, satisfaction declined following the implementation of the district’s more rigorous evaluation system, driven by tenured teachers’ differentially negative impressions. Notably, teacher satisfaction was higher in schools with strong climates, particularly where teachers perceived instructional leadership as effective. These findings underscore the importance of school leaders in the implementation of teacher evaluation policies and suggest that some principals need support fostering school climates focused on instructional improvement and building strong relationships with staff."
