We explore online course enrollment and student outcomes at a large public 4-year system. Online enrollment nearly doubled from 2012 to 2019. Female students and older students were especially likely to take online classes. Students earned more As and Fs in online courses, but semester grade point averages were higher in terms when students took at least one class online. Importantly, taking higher shares of courses online was associated with increased degree completion, with the largest benefits for younger students and male students."

    "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic forced colleges and universities across the nation to switch the way they delivered instruction from primarily in-person course formats to exclusively online. Now, with campuses back to regular business, online and hybrid course formats are here to stay with most colleges continuing to offer courses in a variety of modalities to meet student demand. Offering courses online may give students greater flexibility and freedom over their schedules, especially for students who may be juggling work and/or family responsibilities. On the other hand, students may struggle more in online courses than in their in-person courses if the quality of instruction is lower or if connections with faculty or peers are more limited. In this brief, we highlight findings from our paper, “The Expanding Landscape of Online Education: Who Engages and How They Fare,” which describes patterns in online course taking among undergraduate students enrolled in any University of North Carolina System institution from Fall 2012 to Spring 2020. Specifically, we found the following: 1. In Fall 2019, nearly 40 percent of UNC System undergraduate students enrolled in at least one course online. Online education was expanding, even before the pandemic, and student enrollment in online courses varied greatly across institutions and departments. 2. Female students, older students, and students with lower high school test scores and GPA were more likely to enroll in online courses than their peers. 3. In online courses, students earned both higher and lower grades than in their in-person courses, though GPAs were higher when students took at least one course online than when they took all courses in person. 4. Students who took a higher share of credits online were more likely to attain a Bachelor’s degree within four or six years compared to similar students who took fewer credits online."

Drawing on research from a partnership, led by Matthew Ronfeldt of the University of Michigan, and program leaders at the Tennessee Department of Education and several EPPs in Tennessee, we uncover three key findings: Pre-service teachers with more instructionally effective clinical mentors perform better during their first year as measured by observation and student growth scores, feel more prepared, and report more frequent and higher-quality coaching. Serving as a clinical mentor does not negatively impact teachers’ evaluation scores. *When the state provides districts with lists recommending specific teachers they should target to serve as clinical mentors, they recruit substantially more effective teachers and, as a result, the pre-service candidates those teachers mentor feel more prepared for the classroom."

    "section": "",
    "text": "In the seven years since Tennessee implemented a statewide teacher evaluation system, the percentage of Tennessee teachers who agree that the evaluation system has improved their teaching doubled, going from 38 percent in 2012 to 76 percent in 2019. This rise in satisfaction with evaluation has coincided with increases in student performance on the National Assessment of Education Progress (especially in 2013) and teacher effectiveness (Aldrich, 2019; Putman, Walsh, & Ross, 2018). Still, there is room for improvement. One-quarter of current teachers don’t agree that evaluation has improved their teaching, and this group of teachers is especially likely to view the system as unfair and burdensome. Using data from the annual Tennessee Educator Survey, this snapshot investigates ways that teacher preparation programs, districts, and schools provide teachers with information and supports for evaluation, and how these supports are associated with teacher perceptions of evaluation fairness and burden. Better understanding of how teachers feel about the evaluation process and the supports they receive provides insight into potential levers available to districts and schools to improve the implementation of Tennessee’s statewide educator evaluation system."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Created in 2007, the federal TEACH grant program is a large federal financial aid program that seeks to attract postsecondary students to the teaching profession by providing financial assistance to help pay for a teaching degree. This paper describes the uptake and usage of the federal TEACH grant program across a large four-year public university system. Initial findings suggest that there is considerable room for expanding the number of preservice teachers and institutions utilizing the TEACH grants. While I find no evidence that receiving a TEACH grant reduces student borrowing, these grants do reduce the out-of-pocket costs students face to attend college. Finally, I estimate that students who receive a TEACH grant are approximately 7 percentage points more likely than their peers in the same degree program to continue in and complete teacher education programs. Considering the federal government’s recent interest in reforms to this program, I discuss the implications of this work on potential reform options."

    "text": "Nationally, teachers have experienced major changes to how their performance is evaluated. Teacher satisfaction with the evaluation system likely influences whether they will use the evaluation data to make instructional improvements, yet we know little about teachers’ perceptions of their evaluations. Using survey data from Chicago Public Schools, we explore teacher satisfaction with the evaluation system and their perceptions of its fairness and accuracy. Sixty percent of teachers reported being satisfied with the district’s reformed teacher evaluation. However, satisfaction declined following the implementation of the district’s more rigorous evaluation system, driven by tenured teachers’ differentially negative impressions. Notably, teacher satisfaction was higher in schools with strong climates, particularly where teachers perceived instructional leadership as effective. These findings underscore the importance of school leaders in the implementation of teacher evaluation policies and suggest that some principals need support fostering school climates focused on instructional improvement and building strong relationships with staff."
