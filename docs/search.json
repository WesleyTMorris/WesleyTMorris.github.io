His research examines the early career teacher pipeline, focusing on how policies affect teacher labor markets and influence teacher quality. He pays particular attention to rural schools, studying how well-intentioned reforms can lead to unintended consequences and how policy can be better designed to support students, educators, and leaders in rural communities. Committed to bridging the gap between research, policy, and practice, Wesley works closely with policymakers and practitioners to ensure his research is both informed by their expertise and supports the tough decisions they make every day."

    "text": "Online university courses have become common, though some question whether the modality can adequately substitute for an in-person experience. We explore online course enrollment and student outcomes at a large public 4-year system. Online enrollment nearly doubled from 2012 to 2019. Female students and older students were especially likely to take online classes. Students earned more As and Fs in online courses, but semester grade point averages were higher in terms when students took at least one class online. Importantly, taking higher shares of courses online was associated with increased degree completion, with the largest benefits for younger students and male students."

    "text": "This brief examines whether having a more instructionally effective clinical mentor matters, and what the state, districts, and EPPs can do to ensure that student teaching experiences ready future teachers. Drawing on research from a partnership, led by Matthew Ronfeldt of the University of Michigan, and program leaders at the Tennessee Department of Education and several EPPs in Tennessee, we uncover three key findings: Pre-service teachers with more instructionally effective clinical mentors perform better during their first year as measured by observation and student growth scores, feel more prepared, and report more frequent and higher-quality coaching. Serving as a clinical mentor does not negatively impact teachers’ evaluation scores. *When the state provides districts with lists recommending specific teachers they should target to serve as clinical mentors, they recruit substantially more effective teachers and, as a result, the pre-service candidates those teachers mentor feel more prepared for the classroom."

    "section": "",
    "text": "In the seven years since Tennessee implemented a statewide teacher evaluation system, the percentage of Tennessee teachers who agree that the evaluation system has improved their teaching doubled, going from 38 percent in 2012 to 76 percent in 2019. This rise in satisfaction with evaluation has coincided with increases in student performance on the National Assessment of Education Progress (especially in 2013) and teacher effectiveness (Aldrich, 2019; Putman, Walsh, & Ross, 2018). Still, there is room for improvement. One-quarter of current teachers don’t agree that evaluation has improved their teaching, and this group of teachers is especially likely to view the system as unfair and burdensome. Using data from the annual Tennessee Educator Survey, this snapshot investigates ways that teacher preparation programs, districts, and schools provide teachers with information and supports for evaluation, and how these supports are associated with teacher perceptions of evaluation fairness and burden. Better understanding of how teachers feel about the evaluation process and the supports they receive provides insight into potential levers available to districts and schools to improve the implementation of Tennessee’s statewide educator evaluation system."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Nationally, teachers have experienced major changes to how their performance is evaluated. Teacher satisfaction with the evaluation system likely influences whether they will use the evaluation data to make instructional improvements, yet we know little about teachers’ perceptions of their evaluations. Using survey data from Chicago Public Schools, we explore teacher satisfaction with the evaluation system and their perceptions of its fairness and accuracy. Sixty percent of teachers reported being satisfied with the district’s reformed teacher evaluation. However, satisfaction declined following the implementation of the district’s more rigorous evaluation system, driven by tenured teachers’ differentially negative impressions. Notably, teacher satisfaction was higher in schools with strong climates, particularly where teachers perceived instructional leadership as effective. These findings underscore the importance of school leaders in the implementation of teacher evaluation policies and suggest that some principals need support fostering school climates focused on instructional improvement and building strong relationships with staff."
